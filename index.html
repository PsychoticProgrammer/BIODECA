                    Biodeca is a venture that seeks to help the planet by manufacturing products 
                    that are environmentally friendly. We have made two products, a pencil made 
                    with reused newspaper that has a second use and a plastic case which degrades 
                    after 20 days of being in contact with water.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    We started with the idea of creating ecological products because the pollution 
                    of our planet today is very serious; besides killing innocent beings that have
                    no control over our actions. The neglect of the planet by the human being has 
                    been increasing and it seems that people do not care about it. That is why we 
                    came up; to encourage people to make a change and start helping the planet. 
                    This is just the beginning and an incentive for people to become aware and we 
                    hope that they will also change their way ofthinking.

                    Our goal is to reduce the excessive felling of trees for the manufacture 
                    of pencils; it is known that this has become a problem since 15.3 billion 
                    trees are currently felled for their production. With our pencils, in 
                    addition to reusing newsprint, we help reduce habitat destruction and 
                    biodiversity loss.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The pencil has a capsule with seeds on the top; we put this in so that when 
                    the pencil is no longer useful you can plant it in the ground and make a 
                    plant grow. And so also if our pencils start to be used en masse, there will 
                    be many more plants.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In addition, with our biodegradable sleeves we aim to save millions of marine 
                    lives, as 100,000 marine animals are killed by plastics every year. Turtles 
                    mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and seabirds have their stomachs filled
                    with plastic items. This debris also affects the health of reefs. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The plastic bags are non-toxic, so when ingested by animals they do not cause 
                    harm, and it is estimated that the amount of plastic bags found in the sea 
                    ranges from 5 to 50 billion fragments, not including the pieces that are on 
                    the seabed or on the beaches. Therefore, by dissolving in the water, it solves 
                    one of the biggest environmental problems present on earth today.

                            To make it we use newspaper, which we roll it around a 2mm graphite lead with 
                            a unique paste prepared in a special way that allows a better adhesion to the 
                            lead. On the top we put a capsule with plant seeds for its second use and let 
                            it dry for one or two days. And that's it! We have an ecological pencil.
